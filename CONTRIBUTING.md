# CONTRIBUTING

Hi, welcome to hic et nunc repository. We're happy you're here.

We're trying to optimise the source code little by little, and it is only fair to write some notes on the thinking behind why we're making some of the decisions we're making. Writing this down will help you (the contributor) to get comfortable with the source code.

## Intention

At the moment there's a lot of code repetition. This was mainly due to the heavy experimentation phase in the beginning of this platform. As things start to become more stable and mature, we need to avoid having duplicated code and instead move that code into smaller components that we test (unit testing).

We're also aiming to reduce our dependencies in order to make our javascript bundle smaller, and render the page faster on the client. At the moment, we're using a couple of libraries that slowly will be deprecated. So try to avoid using them if you're contributing with new features. They are:

- `react-loadingg`
- etc

It might not be easy to spot, because there is only one or two pages that have been properly re-writen. There are differences between using a `<button>` or a `<a>` or a `<Link>` (those differences range from security to accessibility, etc). The rule of thumb at the moment is to use `<Link to="/something" />` if you want to change pages within our site. If you want to open a link on an external page, then you need to use `<a href="some-url" target="_blank"/>`, and finally if all you want is to add user interaction with `onClick` please use a `<button>`. This logic has been abstracted for you into a component `src/components/button`. Soon that component will be able to render different views based on props being passed into it. like `<Button primary />` or `<Button secondary />`.

We're currently implementing [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which will be the ideal place where you can check how the components look. We're also currently implementing basic unit testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Components

When creating a component you need to provide a few properties in order to render the component properly. Try to avoid creating prop drilling, or even accessing react context in a component. The components should be as dumb as possible. The only place where you should have access to API requests, or React.Context is at the page level (`src/pages/*`).

In terms of standard its a good practice to first do global imports, then relative imports and finally scss imports. So a component would look something like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react' // a global import
import { Button } from '../button' // a relative import
import styles from './index.module.scss' // a sass import

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className={styles.container}>My Component</div>
}
```

There are some auxiliary components, that aren't doing much besides aiding with the layout. a good example of that is the `/src/pages/objkt-display` where you have `<Container/>` and `<Padding />`. These components are similar to what `reactstrap` provides, but we're trying to minimise our bundle size, so we're reducing on dependencies.

## PR

Pull requests should be as small as possible. At the moment there's a lot of eslint errors everywhere, and instead of fixing them all in one go, and potencially break something and not being able to identify exactly what broke it, we're deciding to go, page by page, component by component fixing those warnings, removing unused code, etc.

Because its been a very small team contributing to this project, we've been mainly contributing directly into the `main` branch, but that wont happen anymore.

We will be using a Git flow approach. This means that you will need to create a feature branch from the `develop` branch, write all your code there, and then when you submit your PR you submit it against the `develop` branch. Once the features on develop are tested and ready to push to production, an Admin will create a PR from `develop` to `main` and kick off a deployment.

If Git flow is something new to you, dont feel intimidated, come and join us on Discord and we'll take the time to help.
